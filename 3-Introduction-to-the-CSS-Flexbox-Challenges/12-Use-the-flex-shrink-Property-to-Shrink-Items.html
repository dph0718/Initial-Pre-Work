<!-- Learned: 
    - The 'flex-shrink' property is applied to children elements of the flex container
    - It determines the amount by which each element will shrink if the container is too small
        to fit the combined width of the elements
    - Its values are numbers, which indicate by how much the element is shrunk 
        i.e., an element with a 'flex-shrink' value of 5 will shrink 5 times more than an element 
        with a 'flex-shrink' value of 1
