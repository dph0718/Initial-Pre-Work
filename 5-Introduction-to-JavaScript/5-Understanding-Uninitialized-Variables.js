/* Learned:
  - Undefined variables will concatenate with strings literally as "undefined"
  - Math done with them will return 'undefined' also 
*/

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a"

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
