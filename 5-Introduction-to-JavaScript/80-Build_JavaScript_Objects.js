/* Learned:
  - A `var` can store an Object.
  - Objects have properties. Properties are assigned values of any type.
  - property names can have strings or numbers as names, but they'll be typecast as strings

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  name: "DOnkey",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 8,
  friends: ['Sam', 'Sam', "Sam", "Samm"]
};
