/* Learned:
  - Bracket notation is to arrays  what bracket notation is for strings.
  -  Except instaed of characters, it's whatever is at that index in the array
*/

// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.

var myData = myArray[0];
