<!-- Learned: 
    - Some browsers (IE) don't support CSS variables.
    - Defining the CSS property with a valid value _before_ defining it with a variable will make sure
        the browser doesn't use its default color, but instead, the color you've assigned before it couldn't read the variable -->

<style>
    :root {
        --red-color: red;

    .red-box {
        background: red;
        background: var(--red-color);
        height: 200px;
        width: 200px;
